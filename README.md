# weeknineteen_textEditor

## Description

My motivation for creating this projest was to show that I could use webpack and its plugins. I made this project learn more about how webpack and service workers interact with other things that I have learned in this course to create a website. This solves the problem of learning about webpack, indexedDB, and Manifest on how they create a website. I learned from this project was how to use webpack and service workers to create a website.
